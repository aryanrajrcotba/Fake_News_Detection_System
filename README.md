üìñ Overview
This project combines a Python Flask backend with a simple HTML/CSS frontend to create a functional Fake News Detection tool. The backend serves a pre-trained PassiveAggressiveClassifier model from Scikit-learn, which predicts the authenticity of news text. The frontend fetches and displays top headlines from the USA via the NewsAPI, allowing users to check any article with a single click.

‚ú® Features
Live News Feed: Fetches and displays real-time news headlines using the NewsAPI.

AI-Powered Classification: Uses a TfidfVectorizer and a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to predict if news content is real or fake.

Simple & Clean UI: A user-friendly interface for browsing news and viewing results.

Deployment Ready: Configured with Gunicorn and Git LFS for seamless deployment on cloud platforms like Render.

Secure API Key Handling: Uses environment variables to keep API keys safe.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Gunicorn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3

API: NewsAPI.org

Deployment: Render, Git, Git LFS

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/aryanrajrcotba/Fake_News_Detection_System.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a Virtual Environment

Bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
The project uses Git LFS for large model files. Make sure you have it installed from git-lfs.github.com.

Bash

# Pull the large model files
git lfs pull

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables
You need a free API key from NewsAPI.org.

Bash

# For Windows (in Command Prompt)
set API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"

# For macOS/Linux
export API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
Note: This variable is only set for the current terminal session. For a more permanent solution, consider using a .env file with python-dotenv.

Run the Application

Bash

flask run
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

üöÄ How to Use
Navigate to the home page to see the latest news articles.
